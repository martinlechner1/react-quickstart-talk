# react-quickstart-talk
Slides and demo code I'll be using for a quickstart to reactjs talk. 

The slides were created with [spectacle from formidable labs](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle). To start the presentation go to the slides folder,  run `yarn` to install and start the presentation with `yarn start`.
